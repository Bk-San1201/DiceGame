It may be hard right now... But you must silence those thoughts! Stop counting only those things that you have lost! What is gone, is gone!
"Loneliness” is no longer part of my vocabulary.
Death is never an apology.
If you lose credibility by just admitting fault, then you didn’t have any in the first place.
If I die here, then I’m a man that could only make it this far.
You need to accept the fact that you’re not the best and have all the will to strive to be better than anyone you face.
Only those who have suffered long, can see the light within the shadows.
Bring on the hardship. It’s preferred in a path of carnage.
Life is like a pencil that will surely run out, but will leave the beautiful writing of life.
Forgetting is like a wound. The wound may heal but it has already left a scar.
When I decided to follow my dream, I had already discarded my life.
There is someone that I must meet again. And until that day…not even Death itself can take my life away!
Don’t try to find a reason for somebody’s love.
Protecting what we cherish most as men is the reason why we formed this pirate crew!
Fools who don’t respect the past are likely to repeat it.
I don’t care if you’re a god. If you lay even one finger on Nami-san, I’ll become the Devil of the Blue Sea!
